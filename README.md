# edge-demo-setup

## aap2-setup (playbook)
Run this playbook to setup the Ansible Automation Platform on OpenShift to be used for the ACM + AAP2 + MICRSOHIFT + EDGE demo
The environment is installed on AWS but can be adapted to any infrastructure with little changes.

## edge-node-setup (playbook)
Run this playbook after the aap2-demo-setup playbook to setup and configure the edge node to host microshift and to be imported automagically to RHACM

## Requirements

The above playbooks should be run on a bastion which has access to the OpenShift instance where Ansible Automation Platform is deployed.

Copy the content of the ec2 instance to files/edge-key.pem file.
It will be used not only to connect to the ec2 instance but to create the edge node credential on ansible too.

A username and password to access RHSM will be required.
It will also be required to have a valid openshift-pull-secret.

If not present on the bastion, please install ansible and awx client
```
sudo dnf install -y ansible

yum-config-manager --add-repo https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/cli/ansible-tower-cli-el8.repo
sudo dnf install -y ansible-tower-cli
```

Install awx cli and the collections required
- sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/cli/ansible-tower-cli-el8.repo
- sudo dnf install -y ansible-tower-cli
- ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml
- Populate the "hosts" inventory file with the name of the ec2 instance, the user and the ssh key
